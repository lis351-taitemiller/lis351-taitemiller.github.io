    <p style="color: ghostwhite"> Below is my current <b><strong>top five rankings</strong></b> of avalible sports animes. The criteria for my classification is that the show includes a Individual or team sport of any region and <b>must</b> teach views some kind of take away lession interms of sportsmanship, respect, the sport itself, or about the character.  From the shows I picked, there must be some creative twist. It can be focused on the personality of a player, the effect of sports, the skill the sport requires, or all of the above. some people dont follow sports in real life, but watching te animated series is completly diffrent!  As you will see below, ill include the anime, a short summary, when it was aired, and where you can watch it.

               <p> All Out (2016) was produced by Telecom Animation Film Studio. it ran for one season of 25 episodes. The anime dives into the sport of rugby in Japan. Kenji Gion is our main character. He is short, fistey, and strong as an ox. He always knew that rugbu players should be tall, strong, and heavy but he didnt let that stop him. This anime follows Gion as he fights his was to his high schools rugby team and his personal evolution. This is a lesser known show like alot of the animes ill pick for this, but teh fan base is still strong.<b>. overall I rate this anime a 10/10!</b> </p>

                <p style="color: hotpink;"> <sub> This photo was taken from <a href= "https://www.bing.com/search?q=haikyu+anime&FORM=AWRE"> CrunchyRoll </a> First tankōbon volume cover, featuring Shoyo Hinata. </sub></p>

              <p> Shōyō Hinata, upon seeing a volleyball match, aims to become the next "Little Giant" and thus, joins his junior high volleyball club. After finding new members, they set out for the junior high school tournament, where they cross paths with a formidable school with the "King of the Upper Court", Tobio Kageyama. Although his team lost, Shōyō is still determined to aim for the top and exact revenge on Kageyama- little did they know, they would both be playing for the same high school team. This anime is close to my heart as a vollyball player, and the light is not usally shown on male players at all. This is a unique anime that combines humor, seriusness, friendship, and respect. <b>I rate this anime a 10/10 just because I actully jumped out of my seat a few times cheering. </b></p>
 


              <li><b> Hinomaru Sumo (2014 to 2019)</b> </li>
              <img src="Sportsimages\9c14fdb98926dc493f8c44bd9a505b0e.jpg"alt ="the cover art for Hinumaru Sumo, with the whole team on the cover" width="500" height="420">

                <p> Hinomaru, a young sumo wrestler challenges his highschools team leader and "strongest" student at the school, Yuma Gojo, to a fight to take back the dojo which was stolen from the team. After and beats him with one hit, Maru gains the respect of his fellow students.Thus, respect is brought to the once dead sumo club. Yuma joins the sumo club after being dragged to a practice match by Hinomaru and seeing how strong the wrestlers are. I knew nothing about sumo wrestling prior to this anime. its not only funny, but its educational. It teaches views about th eorgins and subtle rule of sumo that should be more well known. This is an unconventionla anime but the characters are extreamily likable. <b>Im giving it a ratimg of 8.2/10.</b> </p>




              <li><b>Run With the Wind (2018) </b></li>

Though many of the guys got pulled in against their will, each one pushes himself past his limits to compete in the renowned Hakone Ekiden. Its a short, but sweet anime which focuses on team building and friendship.<b> this manga gets an astounding 9/10 from me!</b></p>
