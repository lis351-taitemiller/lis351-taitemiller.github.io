                <p> Anime Planet summerizes this anime as "Clumsy, good-natured Saya lives a happy life surrounded by her classmates, her admirers, and the loving guidance of her father, the priest of a shrine. But mysterious, bloodthirsty monsters have begun to appear, and as the daughter of the shrine, Saya is tasked with keeping the village safe â€“ even if it costs the girl her life. Now, between her schoolwork and friendships, Saya must pick up the sword and keep these brutal creatures at bay". watching this anime took a few episodes to get me hooked. It started slow and but the plot thicked when monsters started attacking and we got to see a bada** side of Saya. I recomed this anime to someone who understand the structure of a slow burn series and doesnt mind blood/gore.<b> this manga gets an astounding 7/10 from me!</b></p>
