                <p> Rosario + Vampire (2008) is a much more adult and comedic romance. Sukune Aono is an average teenager who is unable to get into any high school because of his bad grades. His parents inadvertently enroll him into Youkai Academy as a last-ditch effort to secure his education.  Oukai Academy is a seemingly normal boarding school, except that its pupils are monsters learning to coexist with humans. Here Sukune and love intrest Moka go on a series of adventures with friends while romance buds. Though there is alot of fan-service and over animation, the female leads are extreamly strong and think for themselves. This is one of my childhood favorites which I still watch now and <b>Im giving it a ratimg of 10/10.</b> </p>
