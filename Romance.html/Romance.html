		<p style="color: ghostwhite"> Below is my current <b><strong>top five rankings</strong></b> of avalible action animes. The criteria for my classification is that the show includes fights with bare knuckles, firearms, and/or non-firearm weapons such as swords and blades and whatever the imagination can come up with. Action can be expressed through any artistic choice of the director. From the shows I picked, there must be some aspect of danger which helps add to the suspence and action plot of the anime. As you will see below, ill include the anime, a short summary, when it was aired, and where you can watch it. </p>

               <p> Mashle debuted in 2023 (ongoing), soon becoming a hit due to its loose basis off of Harry Potter's plot. A young Mash Burned is the only human who can't use magic; yet he is enrolled in a prestigious school for magic. Mashle: Magic and Muscles" is like what would happen if Harry Potter went to the gym and got swole. He relies heavily on plot armor and strength to get through magical obstacles standing in his way. One audience member commented "it’s every bit as hilarious and awesome as it sounds. The show shines with its irreverent humor, poking fun at overused fantasy tropes while delivering some surprisingly heartfelt moments"- John Doe. <b> I rate this anime a strong 8.5/10 </b> which is similar to the Rotten Tomatoes ranking of 83%. It's easy to watch if you are just getting into anime, but still offers original tropes that are seen in traditional shonen animes. </p>

               <p> Hunter x Hunter (2011-2014) is considered an all time favorite across many consumers of anime. The plot follows a young group of aspiring hunters who travel the world capturing criminals, treasures, and discovering new lands. Gon Freecs and Killua Zoldyck, both 12, are the main characters. Gon is aiming to find his absent father who was a pro hunter while killua is searching for a life away from his assassin family. The anime is engaging for beginners and has an array of diversity that will draw more people to watch and identify themselves with the show.<b> I rate this show a 10/10.</b> It's funny, unique, and family friendly with a Rotten Tomato rating of 97%.

              	<p style="color: hotpink;"> <sub> This photo was taken from <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9058134/mediaviewer/rm1409911041/"> the offical IMDB website </a> and credits go to Netflix originals. </sub></p>

              <p> This anime holds a special place in my heart. Kengan Ashura (2012-2018) tells the story of the young fighter Oma Tokita with a tragic backstory. This criminally underrated anime follows Oma as he becomes a hired gladiator for manager Kazuo Yamashita, tasked at fighting in the underground deathmatch nicknamed "Kengan Zetsumei Tournament". Oma and Kazuo, both in need of money,  risk their lives for the spot of chairmen of the underground company by aiming to win the tournament. This anime will keep any watcher on the edge of their seat and doesn't just involve straightforward martial arts. There is a mixture of crime, fighting, love, and showmanship to make this the perfect action anime. the animation style for a Netflix original is also impressive. PlzLawme on Reddit stated "The art is pretty interesting. I've never seen it drawn like this before. Almost looks like they're 3D models". This  Neflix original and can be found under the anime tab. <b>I rate this anime a 8.9/10.</b></p>

                <p> Black Bulter was one of my favorite shows as a child. Its been running since 2006 and its still ongoing. This anime has one of the largest overall fandoms worldwide. This is an action packed thriller baised off of the famous crimes of victorian London. It follows Ceil Fantomhive, a famous heir to the Fantomhive fortune, and his summoned deamon butler Sebastion as they solve murder mystorys while fighting crime. The animetion of this anime is absolutly breathtaking and the plot has no filler epidodes which keeps it engaging. This is a great anime to choose if your into the dark arts, mystery, and fighting mythilogical beasts! On the Black Butler Reddit forrem, couch-tommato posted "I'd definitely say it's worth watching. It's nicely dark" when raving about the show.<b>Im giving it a ratimg of 8.6/10.</b> </p>
